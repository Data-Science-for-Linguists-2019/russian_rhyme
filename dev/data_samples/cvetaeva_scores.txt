Cvetaeva Novogodnee (1927)
Multiple versions, other poems by the same name


Brodsky, Joseph. “Footnote to a poem.” In his: *Less than one - selected essays.*

Toker, Leona. “Tsvetaeva's Novogodnee.” *The explicator*; Vol. 47, Iss. 1, (Fall 1988): 31–33.

Feature-based clustering produces worse results, with greater distances
Quite sparse because of both missing segments and missing features
Overweights consonants because they have more features than vowels (this could be tweaked)
No apparent benefit, since segment clustering is generally good
