    "Above we identify three ways to represent information about consonant clusters:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tokenization (V ~ C(C)) and treatment of the consonant tokens as indivisible (that is, regarding /rv/ and /r/ each as a separate one-hot feature) fails to capture the fact that /rv/ and /r/ have something in common phonetically, that is, that both contain /r/.\n",
    "1. Decomposing consonant clusters into segments and multi-hot encoding on those segments improves on the preceding by capturing the fact that /rv/ and /r/ share a segment, that is, a feature that can be used for clustering. But it fails to capture the fact that the phonetic distance between segments, defined in terms of shared distinctive features, is variable. For example, the two segments in /rv/ agree on being **+continuant**, while those in /rb/ disagree on that feature, and therefore are more distant phonetically than the segments in /rv/. Encoding each segment as a feature means that /rv/ and /rb/ would both be represented as equally distant. (**Note:** Although perhaps they should be!)\n",
    "1. Distinctive feature decomposition improves on the preceding because it does not regard all segments as equally distant from all other segments. Instead, the distance is a function of the number of distinctive feature values the segments share. For example, the value for the **continuant** feature for /rv/ is `1`, since /r/ and /v/ are both **+continuant**, while the value for /rb/ is `0.5` because /r/ is **+continuant** and /b/ is **-continuant**."

    "1. The preceding approach treats all features as independent of one another, but some are contingent. For example, **+lateral** predetermines *all* other features except palatalization. Can we reduce overweighting due to redundancy by applying dimensionality reduction?\n",
    "1. We continue to lose, as with all methods discussed here, information about the *order* of consonants."
