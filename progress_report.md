For the 1st progress report, **focus on your data**. This milestone consists of 30 data points and 10 presentation points. Goals:

* Attempt and mostly complete the data acquisition process.
* Start and make a head way into cleaning and reorganizing your data.
* By now, you should have concrete ideas on the “data end game”: what your data’s final form will be like, the target total size, format, etc.
* Devise a couple of options regarding the “sharing plan” of your data.

Contents:

1. progress_report.md
	* Create a section entitled “1st Progress Report”, and then provide a summary of what you accomplished. Keep it short (a screen-full), and provide links to related documents, including your Jupyter Notebook and data samples.
	* Include a subsection where you outline a couple of options (or a single option, if you are fairly sure) regarding the “sharing plan” for your data. You should plan out how much and what you will be sharing. Make sure to include a justification.
2. A python script in the form of a Jupyter Notebook.
	* Provide an overview of your data. Clearly document each step of your data processing pipeline.
	* Compile some basic stats on your data: the size and the make up are the bare minimum.
	* Bullet points have their uses, but let’s see some written summaries and explanations too.
	* Remember: your Jupyter Notebook file is also your presentation. Make it easy for the instructors and your classmates to understand what you are doing. Explain your goals, show your data and your processes.
3. Some *form* of your data. If all of your data is currently stored in a git-ignored directory, make an appropriately sized samples available in a directory called `data_samples/`.
	
Above are the minimum requirements, but do feel free to impose additional organization as you see fit. This is your project after all! But when you do so, make sure you provide an explanation.
