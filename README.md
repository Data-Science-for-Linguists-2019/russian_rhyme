**Credit:** This project is a contribution to [Meter, rhythm, and rhyme: the computationally assisted analysis of formal features in Russian poetry](http://poetry.obdurodon.org/), co-developed by David J. Birnbaum and Elise Thorsen. The content here builds on collaborative work from that larger project.
